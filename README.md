# parked-domain-helper
A basic user interface to create a parked domain helper that allows any GitHub user to submit an idea and/or be transferred the domain (for the cost of domain + reasonable small fee).

This is ideal for extraneous domains for side projects that are not completed or domains you are happy to let go.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Must be able to host the parker site anywhere (Vercel, S3, GitHub Pages)
- The solution must be as simple as setting an A/AAAA/CNAME on a domain or point to a nameserver that always resolves correctly.
- Be able to customise buttons per domain
